public class hello{  // if using public keyword class name eg hello needs to be same as filename as hello.java
    // if want different name like test.java but with hello class inside need to remove public keyword
    public static void main(String args[]){
        // String - S is in caps no small letter as it is class/wrapper class in java not a primitive datatype
        //String primitive counterpart does not exist like int (primitive) for Integer(wrapper class)
